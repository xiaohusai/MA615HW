We want to know how many pages in a book will have more than 8 misprints.
Make an n x k table that shows the probability that n or fewer pages in a 50 page book
will have more than 8 misprints.

We use possion distribution with lambda 2 to calculate the probability of more than 8 misprints on a page. After we know the probability of more than 8 misprints on a page, we can use it into binomial distribution to figure out the probability that there are no more than n pages with more than 8 misprints. Then we input these probabilities we got from the binomial distribution in to the table we created by using the as.data.frame function. 

```{r}


library(knitr) 
library(kableExtra)

x <- c(1:8)
y <- c(1:50)

plist <- as.data.frame(matrix(ncol = 8, nrow = 50, dimnames = list(y,x)))


  for (j in x){
    for (i in y){
      p5mis <- ppois(j,2,lower.tail=FALSE)
        plist[i,j] <- pbinom(i,50,p5mis)}
}


knitr::kable(plist)
colnames(plist)<-x
```


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("abook.jpg")



```
